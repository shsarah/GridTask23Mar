                                I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time
                                of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,

                                 I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
                                 step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
                                 who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriciulum
                                 and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
                                 for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
                                 my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In 
                                 fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
